### Graduation Strategy
When a subdomain product achieves significant success:

1. **Phase 1:** Maintain "Of Tomorrow" branding while building independent recognition
2. **Phase 2:** Introduce shortened versions ("Translations" alongside "Translations Of Tomorrow")
3. **Phase 3:** Graduate to independent domain while maintaining visual connection to parent brand
4. **Phase 4:** Full independence with "Powered by Of Tomorrow" attribution

### Domain Structure
```
